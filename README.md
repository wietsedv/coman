# Poco: Simpler Conda dependency management

A simple CLI for Conda dependency management. Poco gives you simple commands to manage dependencies in your `environment.yml` and properly uses lockfiles. Moreover, it manages unique Conda environments per project directory. Poco mimicks the workflow of [**Po**etry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) (or any other modern dependency manager), but then for **Co**nda.

Under the hood, Poco heavily relies on [mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) and [conda-lock](https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-lock).
